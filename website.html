    Bio:
     Heyyy!!! My name is Perla and i am a white female poodle dog that is very friendly and playful.
     My favorite thing to do is play with kids because they are really fun to play with.
     My favorite food is meat when my owner give me vegetables i vomit because i get discussed.
     I actually get a little mad when a stranger comes to my owners home because they don't
     seem like they are friendly but once i meet them i try to be friendly with them even though i don't
     like a person i still try to be friendly cause then my owner gets me in trouble. Some strangers look
     mean and some look friendly i know when someone is trying to come to my owners home because they just
      stare at me and i really don't like when they stare at me. For fun sometimes i just like chasing the mailman:)
